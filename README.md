## Analysis of Apple Transactions with PySpark on Databricks

### Overview
This project demonstrates how to build ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines using PySpark on Databricks. It includes data ingestion from various sources (CSV, Parquet, Delta Table), uses the Factory Pattern for flexible reader creation, and implements business logic through the PySpark DataFrame API and Spark SQL. The processed data is then stored in both a Data Lake and a Data Lakehouse for further analysis. The project also addresses common PySpark issues such as broadcast joins, partitioning and bucketing, window functions (LAG, LEAD), and Delta tables.

### Key Concepts and Techniques
- ETL Pipelines with PySpark
- Factory Pattern
- PySpark DataFrame API and Spark SQL
- Data Lake and Data Lakehouse

### Implementation, Transformation, and Analysis Steps

#### 1. Data Source Ingestion
- Use PySpark to read data from CSV, Parquet, and Delta Table sources utilizing the Factory Pattern for creating reader objects.
- Configure file paths or Delta table locations for data access.

#### 2. Data Transformation
- Employ PySpark DataFrame API and Spark SQL for data cleaning, filtering, and shaping to prepare for analysis. Examples include:
  - Handling missing values or invalid data.
  - Creating new columns or features from existing data.
  - Filtering data based on specific criteria.

#### 3. Business Logic and Analysis
- Perform core analysis tasks using PySpark functions:
  - **Identify customers who purchased both iPhone and AirPods:** Use filtering and joins to identify these customers.
  - **Find customers who bought only iPhone and AirPods:** Further filter to select customers who did not purchase other products.
  - **List products bought after initial purchase:** Use window functions like LAG or LEAD to track subsequent purchases.
  - **Calculate average time delay between iPhone and AirPod purchases:** Use window functions and timestamps.
  - **Determine top 3 selling products in each category:** Use grouping, aggregation (e.g., `sum`), and sorting operations.

#### 4. Data Loading
- Store the transformed data in both a Data Lake (e.g., raw data format) and a Data Lakehouse (e.g., curated data format) using Delta tables or other suitable storage options.

### Additional Considerations
- **Error Handling:** Implement mechanisms to handle potential issues during data ingestion or processing.
- **Scalability:** Use techniques like partitioning and bucketing to optimize data access patterns for large datasets.
- **Testing:** Write unit tests to ensure the correctness and consistency of ETL pipelines and analysis logic.

### Further Enhancements
- **Code Documentation:** Add comments to enhance code readability and maintainability.
- **Job Scheduling:** Utilize tools like Apache Airflow or Databricks Workflows to automate ETL pipeline execution.

### Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive guide to building ETL pipelines and performing data analysis with PySpark on Databricks. It highlights essential techniques and delves into lower-level details. By incorporating the suggested improvements, the project's structure, maintainability, and robustness can be further enhanced.
